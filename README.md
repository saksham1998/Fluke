# Introduction:
Fluke is real time chat app, which uses Socket IO and multiple libraries for the communication between server and client.With the help of 
socket io, Fluke stores the users on server and show them when needed.

# How To Use:
Fluke contains two HTML pages:
1. **Index** : It is sign up/log in page.It contains the form which includes your name and room name. Your Name will be used to show your messages 
to others and room name is for connecting with the people.                                
                     (Note: If room name does'nt exist , Fluke will automatically create a new room with the provided room name.)

2. **Chat** : It would be the main page. It will show all the users connected to the room. From this page, users will be able to communicate to each 
other. Chat page mainly contains three parts , i.e list of members,previous messages and message box.
